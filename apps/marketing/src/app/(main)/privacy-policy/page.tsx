          <p>
            <br />
            Skybeam's platform allows advertisers to manage digital ad campaigns
            across several channels (e.g. websites, apps, smart TVs) and helps
            ensure ads are relevant to you (the ‚Äúconsumer‚Äù) while measuring the
            ad campaign‚Äôs performance. Our technology uses data associated with
            online and offline behavior to devices that may be linked to the
            same person or household, thereby improving ad targeting and
            limiting how often someone sees the same ad.

            The California Consumer Privacy Act or "CCPA" (California Civil Code
            Section 1798.100 et seq.) applies to the collection, use, and
            disclosure of "personal information" collected from California
            residents (as those terms are defined by the CCPA). CCPA Personal
            Information (CCPA PI) is defined by California law as information
            that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being
            associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or
            indirectly, with California consumers or households. The CCPA
            requires us to disclose to California consumers the categories of
            personal information (as defined in the CCPA) we collect, our
            business and commercial purposes for collecting, using, or selling
            such personal information, the categories of sources from which we
            collect personal information, the categories of personal information
            we have disclosed or sold for a business or commercial purpose in
            the preceding 12 months, and the categories third parties with whom
            we share personal information. We have provided these disclosures
            below.

            <br />
            If you are a California consumer as defined by the CCPA, you may
            have the right to: (i) request access to your personal information
            and request additional details about our information practices, (ii)
            request deletion of your personal information, (iii) opt out of the
            "sale" of your personal information (as that term is defined by the
            CCPA), and (iv) to not be discriminated against for exercising any
            of your rights under the CCPA.
            <br />
            <br />
            Your options regarding the personal information we collect or
